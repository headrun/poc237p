Kolade,"Areo, ACA","Manager, KPMG Channel Islands Limited","Exactly 10 years today, I walked into The Penisula Resort in Lekki Nigeria to attend the KPMG Academy (KBAC) hence started my career with KPMG Nigeria that Monday morning 10 years today. Have spent more than 9 years of my 10 years work experience with the KPMG brand and that obviously has been one of my best decisions. 

I have learnt with and from working with many brilliant minds in KPMG and have built friendships that have lasted the years. I have been helped greatly by my support system (family and friends). The most significant milestone for me has obviously been the friendships built and helping many young accountants over the past few years to truly measure up to their potentials cos we all have needed some people to push us on at some points in our careers especially on those bad days. 

I feel so blessed for the last 10 years and I know there is even more to be accomplished ahead!",286,48
