Diezani Alison-Madueke,"Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). 
According to media reports, the Central Bank of Nigeria announced in May 2016 that it was participating in the investigation into corruption targeting the former oil minister.","Art.16, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdictions,,,"In a 2017 civil forfeiture complaint, the U.S. DOJ alleges that from 2011 to 2015, Nigerian businessmen Kolawole Akanni Aluko and Olajide Omokore conspired with others to pay bribes to Nigeria’s former Minister for Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, who oversaw Nigeria’s state-owned oil company. Diezani Alison-Madueke, a former President of OPEC, allegedly used her influence to steer lucrative oil contracts to two Nigerian shell companies set up and controlled by Aluko and Omokore.
The U.S. Department of Justice seeks recovery of $144 million in assets connected to Diezani Alison-Madueke, Kolawole Aluko, and Olajide Omokore, which it says are the proceeds of corruption in Nigeria. The assets subject to forfeiture include a $50 million condominium in One57 - 157 W. 57th Street - one of Manhattan’s most expensive buildings, and an $80 million yacht, known as Galactica Star.
The U.S. government further alleges that Aluko, Omokore and others funded a lavish lifestyle for Alison-Madueke, conspiring to purchase millions of dollars in real estate in and around London for Alison-Madueke and her family members, then renovated and furnished these homes with millions of dollars in furniture, artwork and other luxury items purchased at two Houston-area furniture stores at Alison-Madueke’s direction. Aluko and Omokore also laundered proceeds into and through the U.S, and used it to purchase U.S. real estate. During the period from March 2012 through January 2015, Aluko purchased more than $87 million dollars’ worth of real property in the United States and an $82 million luxury yacht, according to the DOJ complaint.","According to the U.S. DOJ’s civil forfeiture complaint, in return for the bribes, Alison-Madueke allegedly used her influence as Petroleum Minister to direct a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to award contracts to two shell companies created by Aluko and Omokore: Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Ltd. and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Ltd, in 2011 and 2012. The companies were incorporated in Nigeria in 2010 and 2013 respectively, and were both owned by holding companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, beneficially owned by Aluko and Omokore. Omokore acted as a registered director of both Nigerian companies.
Under the contracts, the two companies were required to finance the exploration and production operations of eight on-shore oil and gas blocks. However, according to the DOJ complaint, the companies provided only a fraction of the agreed upon financing or, in some instances, failed entirely to provide it. The companies also failed to meet other contractual obligations, including the payment of a $120 million entry fee. Nevertheless, the companies were allegedly permitted to lift and sell more than $1.5 billion worth of Nigerian crude oil.
A February 2014 report prepared by the then-governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria determined that Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Ltd “had neither the technical expertise nor the capital to develop the joint venture, but [was] none-the-less able to lift crude and retain the proceeds . . . up to 70% of the profit of the Joint Venture.” The report concluded that the arrangement was set up “for the purpose of acquiring assets belonging to the [Federal Republic of Nigeria] and transferring the income to private hands.”
Atlantic Energy Brass Development Ltd allegedly sold $811 million worth of crude oil over the course of one year to a UK subsidiary of Glencore, “despite failing to meet any obligations” under its contract with the Nigerian state-owned oil company, according to the DOJ.
In addition to the Nigerian companies and its BVI holding companies, the conspirators also set up a number of other BVI-registered companies and at least three companies incorporated in the Seychelles that were used by Aluko and Omokore to purchase real estate in the United Kingdom, allegedly for the benefit of Alison-Madueke. The $82 million yacht was bought by a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands that was controlled and beneficially owned by Kolawore Aluko; the sale was brokered by a financial and corporate services company based in Guernsey. At least three companies incorporated in U.S. states – Nevada, Delaware, and California – were used by conspirators to spend corrupt funds at a furniture store in Houston, pay for transportation services, and purchase a property in Santa Barbara, California.
Alison-Madueke is also under investigation by the National Crime Agency in the U.K., where she currently resides, for corruption and money laundering. In Nigeria, the former Petroleum minister is under investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for diverting money from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC), but as of September 2017, no charges had been filed against her related to this case. She has been charged for money laundering in connection to a separate election-bribery case. Local Nigerian media reports say that EFCC recently blocked her application to travel to Nigeria and join the trial against her associate Omokore as a defendant, arguing that it was a ploy to escape prosecution in the U.K."
1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) (United States),"Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (referenced in the FBI's press release, 20 July 2016)","Art.17, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdictions,Ongoing case,$30 million,"Members of an international conspiracy allegedly diverted “more than $4.5 billion” in state funds from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund wholly owned by the government of Malaysia, according to a series of civil forfeiture complaints filed in 2016 and 2017 under the U.S. DOJ Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. The United States is seeking to recover “almost $1.7 billion” of 1MDB funds that were allegedly laundered through the United States and are traceable to the conspiracy in “the largest single action ever brought under the [U.S. DOJ’s] Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.” In August 2017, the U.S. DOJ asked for a stay of the civil forfeiture cases pending the conclusion of a related federal criminal investigation.
The DOJ complaints allege that “using fraudulent documents and representations, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered the funds through a series of complex transactions and fraudulent shell companies with bank accounts located in the Singapore, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the United States. These transactions were allegedly intended to conceal the origin, source and ownership of the funds, and were ultimately processed through U.S. financial institutions and were used to acquire and invest in assets located in the United States.”
U.S. assets that were allegedly purchased with diverted 1MDB funds and are subject to forfeiture actions include high end real estate and hotel properties in New York, Los Angeles, and London; a $35 million jet airplane; a 300-foot luxury yacht; works of art by Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Claude Monet; a substantial interest in the music publishing rights of EMI Music; the production of the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street; shares in Tech company Palantir and fitness company Flywheel; gambling expenses at Las Vegas casinos; and over $27.3m worth of diamond jewelry.
As of June 2018, U.S. authorities have frozen or restrained over $1.6 billion in assets related to this case. These assets are subject to ongoing, active litigation. Around $30 million in assets forfeited by U.S. authorities have been fully adjudicated. The restrained assets are located in the United States, Switzerland, Indonesia, Singapore, and London.
Prosecutors portray a Malaysian national called Jho Low as the mastermind of the complex embezzlement scheme. Although he held no official position with 1MDB, he de facto conducted extensive business for the state fund and set up a myriad of opaque shell companies around the world through which 1MDB funds were diverted and ultimately channeled into the United States, for the personal benefit of members of the conspiracy. Other conspirators allegedly implicated include a group of high-ranking Malaysian officials at 1MDB, two high-ranking UAE officials at an investment fund owned by Abu Dhabi government (Khadem Abdulla Al-Qubaisi and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny), and two Saudi nationals affiliated with a little-known Saudi oil company (PetroSaudi International). Malaysia’s former prime minister Najib Razak and his stepson Riza Aziz are allegedly implicated in the scheme and benefitted from diverted 1MDB funds, with Razak receiving funds totaling approximately $681 million directly into a bank account in his name, according to the U.S. DOJ’s forfeiture complaints. One of the conspirators, Al-Husseiny, served as chairman of Falcon Bank, a private bank in Singapore and Switzerland, that was allegedly extensively used for moving and laundering funds in the scheme.
To divert funds from the 1MDB fund, disguise their origin, disguise the identity of the conspirators, and launder funds into the United States, prosecutors claim that the members of the conspiracy set up a vast network of corporate vehicles in offshore secrecy jurisdictions around the world. Corporate vehicles employed in this scheme were incorporated in jurisdictions including Seychelles, British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, United Arab Emirates, Curaçao, Malaysia, Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and the United States (New York, Delaware). The diverted funds were allegedly transferred through bank accounts belonging to these companies in, among others, Singapore, Switzerland, USA, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, and Barbados, with a majority of the money at some point passing through Singapore accounts, according to the forfeiture complaints.
Prosecutors further claim that several corporate vehicles were deceptively named to mimic an affiliation with a genuine, operational entity that 1MDB was doing business with or to mimic an affiliation with well-known global financial service companies, when in fact no such affiliation existed. Two shell companies, both called “Aabar Investments PJS Ltd”, one registered in BVI and the other in the Seychelles, were named to give the impression that the CV was associated with Aabar Investments PJS, a legitimate subsidiary of Abu Dhabi investment company IPIC, which entered into a joint venture agreement with 1MDB. “Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd”, “Affinity Equity International Partners Limited”, “Vista Equity International Partners Ltd” were all named to mimic well-known global financial service companies. Also of note is the alleged use of an Interest on Lawyer Account (IOLA) and another attorney trust account held by U.S. law firms to launder diverted funds into the U.S. by purchasing real estate assets. Transfers totaling $368 million were made directly from an account of a Seychelles shell company to an IOLA account of a U.S. law firm.
The U.S. DOJ forfeiture complaints outline four distinct phases of the complex corruption scheme, named after key corporate vehicles that were employed: (1) the “Good Star” Phase, 2009-2011; (2) the “Aabar-BVI” Phase, 2012; (3) the “Tanore” Phase, 2013; and (4) the “Options Buyback” Phase, 2014.
During the “Good Star” Phase, 1MDB officials entered a joint venture agreement with PetroSaudi International, a little-known Saudi oil company founded in 2005 by a son of the late King Abdullah, for the stated purpose of exploiting certain energy concessions in Turkmenistan and Argentina. Under the terms of the agreement, 1MDB agreed to invest $1 billion in the newly created joint venture in exchange for a forty percent equity interest. 1MDB only transferred US$300 million into the account of the “legitimate” joint venture company and allegedly diverted US$700 million into a bank account at RBS Coutts, Switzerland, that was held by Good Star Limited, a Seychelles-registered corporate vehicle beneficially owned by Jho Low. Conspirators made false representations to banks that Good Star was a wholly-owned subsidiary of PetroSaudi.
During the “Aabar-BVI” Phase, 1MDB raised additional funds through two separate bond offerings arranged and underwritten by Goldman Sachs. The bonds were guaranteed by both 1MDB and International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), an investment fund wholly-owned by the government of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. 1MDB officials allegedly caused approximately $1.367 billion (40% of the bond proceeds) to be wire transferred to a Swiss bank account belonging to a British Virgin Islands entity that was deceptively named to mimic a legitimate subsidiary of IPIC.
During the “Tanore” Phase, several individuals, including 1MDB officials, allegedly diverted more than $1.26 billion out of a total of $3 billion in principal that 1MDB raised through a third bond offering arranged by Goldman Sachs in March 2013, via two bank accounts in Singapore held by a BVI-registered company.
During the “Options Buyback” phase, an additional $850 million in 1MDB funds was allegedly misappropriated under the guise of paying an IPIC subsidiary to relinquish certain options 1MDB had given in return for IPIC’s guarantee of the 2012 bonds. To fund this options buyback, 1MDB borrowed a total of $1.225 billion from a syndicate of banks led by Deutsche Bank in Singapore, of which more than $850 million was allegedly diverted via two companies incorporated in BVI and in the Seychelles.","In August 2017, the U.S. DOJ asked for a temporary stay of the civil forfeiture cases related to the 1MDB case, pending conclusion of related federal criminal investigations. In an affidavit supporting the government's motion to stay the forfeiture cases, a FBI special agent wrote: ""The related criminal investigation is global in scope because the underlying crimes were committed over several years in numerous jurisdictions. Perpetrators, which includes both entities and individuals acting in individual and representative capacities, are believed to have committed violations of both U.S. and foreign laws. A significant amount of the evidence and witnesses with knowledge of these violations are located in foreign jurisdictions, and will take time to pursue."" The FBI agent warned that any further disclosure of information in the civil cases would risk revealing ""potential targets and subjects of the investigation and the investigative techniques that have been and will be used in the investigation."" No further information about the criminal cases is publicly available, as of June 2018. "
Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (11 luxury cars seized in Geneva),,"Art.16, Art.17, Art.19, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdictions,Ongoing Case,,"In November 2016, Swiss authorities seized 11 luxury cars as part of criminal proceedings opened against Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime leader, on suspicions of money laundering. The prosecutor’s office said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters: “The Geneva public prosecutor confirms the opening of criminal proceedings against Teodorin Obiang. The latter is accused of money laundering.” “As part of the procedure, 11 vehicles were effectively sequestered in the cargo area of ​​Geneva airport on behalf of the prosecution.""
The cars seized by the Geneva police were a Bugatti Veyron, four Ferraris including an Enzo and 599GTB, a Porsche 918 Spyder, a Lamborghini Veneno, a Maybach, a Koenigesegg, an Aston Martin and a McLaren P1, the Geneva prosecutor’s office said. According to media reports, the Bugatti Veyron is worth $2 million and the Swedish-made Koenigegg One is one of only seven ever produced for $2.8 million. The total value of the 11 cars has not been reported - but the value of only two of the 11 cars (Bugatti Veyron & Koenigegg One) totals $4.8 million. Media reports estimate the total value to be ""more than $8 million"".
Equatorial Guinea filed a legal challenge to the seizure, arguing that the cars do not belong to Obiang but to a state company and were only in Geneva for repairs. In July 2017, the Swiss Federal Court rejected the request from the government of Equatorial Guinea to release the luxury cars. ",
"Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue (""Ebony Shine"" yacht)",,"Art.16, Art.17, Art.19, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdictions,Ongoing Case,,"According to a Dutch court order (ECLI: NL: RBOVE: 2017: 1630), on 2 December 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office in Geneva, Switzerland, submitted a request for legal assistance to the Dutch Public Prosecution Service, Zwolle location. The reason for this request was the start of an investigation by the Public Prosecution Service in Geneva on 31 October 2016 against Obiang, Vice President of Equatorial Guinea and son of the President, in connection with money laundering. According to the Public Prosecutor's Office in Geneva, the defendant bought a yacht, Ebony Shine, that was docked in (near) Makkum at the time of the start of the investigation. The Swiss prosecution had a strong suspicion that the yacht was bought through acts of misconduct in a public office and bribery, with funds from Equatorial Guinea, that the defendant uses the yacht exclusively for private purposes and that jure imperii activities of the state of Equatorial Guinea are not involved. The Geneva Public Prosecutor requested that the yacht be seized.
On December 2, 2016, at the request of the Swiss authorities, the Dutch authorities seized Mr. Obiang’s 250-foot, $120 million yacht, “Ebony Shine,” as it was about to sail to Equatorial Guinea. Mr. Obiang has denied ownership of the yacht, and the government of Equatorial Guinea started legal proceedings in Zwolle, Netherlands to release and return the yacht to the government of Equatorial Guinea. Government lawyers argued in a Dutch court that the yacht belonged to his country’s government and was used for defense purposes. In April 2017, the yacht was placed in sequestration in Den Helder port after a judge in Zwolle ruled that the vessel be held by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service (openbaar ministerie) while its owner is investigated under charges of corruption in Switzerland and France.
By a letter of 5 December 2016, the Public Prosecution Service in Geneva additionally requested to seize all available private and public documents relating to the Ebony Shine.  On the basis of a decision of 6 December 2016 of the examining magistrate, the Ebony Shine was searched on 8 December 2016, in which a number of goods were seized.
During the proceedings, it was revealed that the yacht is formally owned by a company Named Dara Ltd, registered in the Marshall Islands. Lawyers representing Equatorial Guinea in the Dutcg court stated that Dara Ltd is owned 100% by the Ministry of Defense of Equatorial Guinea. The vessel, built by Feadship in Makkum, has two jaccuzis, a spa, a pool and gym, a helipad, several jetskis and a cinema seating 12.
Swiss prosecutors had opened their investigation into Obiang in 2016. in July 2017, a Swiss Federal Court turned down a demand by the government of Equatorial Guinea to release the impounded yacht, which is moored in the Netherlands. 
Eleven luxury cars were seized at Geneva airport in October/November 2016 as part of the same investigation - see ARW-253",
Family of former President Sani Abacha,,"Art.16, Art.17, Art.19, Art.20, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdictions,,,"The Federal Government of Nigeria, the Swiss Federal Council and the World Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the repatriation and monitoring of $321 million of funds illicitly acquired by the family of the late former President of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha on 04 December 2017. The MOU was signed during the Global Forum on Asset Recovery, a three-day forum hosted by the United Kingdom and the United States with support from the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative. It was signed by Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami; Switzerland’s Secretary of State and Head of the Directorate of International Law at the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Roberto Balzaretti; and the World Bank’s country director for Nigeria, Rachid Benmessaoud.
The MOU captures the tripartite agreement on the World Bank’s monitoring role and the proposed modalities of the funds repatriation and disbursement. The signing of the MOU followed a December 2014 Swiss court order that the funds be repatriated, on the condition that the World Bank would monitor their use.
This MOU followed through on a Letter of Intent that was signed by Nigeria and Switzerland in March 2016 in Abuja, aimed at regulating the return to Nigeria of assets totaling USD 321 million stolen by Nigeria's former dictator Sani Abacha. The letter of intent was signed by the Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter and Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.
This return of stolen assets was made possible after the Attorney General of the Canton of Geneva confiscated these assets, which had originally been deposited in bank accounts in Luxembourg, pursuant to a forfeiture order dated 11 December 2014. 
The Nigerian authorities requested the funds be used to support a program of targeted cash transfers to poor and vulnerable Nigerians under the National Social Safety Net Project financed by a credit extended by the World Bank. The responsibility for the use of the funds is with the Federal Government of Nigeria. The World Bank’s role is to provide institutional support and monitoring of the use of these funds. According to the World Bank’s press release, the parties have agreed to establish monitoring framework for the use of the repatriated funds that will enhance transparency and accountability. To that end, the Federal Government of Nigeria will engage civil society organizations to help monitor the use of the funds.
According to media reports, Nigeria’s minister of finance Kemi Adeosun through her special advisor Oluyinka Akintunde confirmed the receipt of money from Switzerland in December 2017, with $1.5 million in interest. Akintunde said: ""We state that $322,515,931.83 (N116,105,735,458.80) was received into a Special Account in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Dec. 18, 2017, from the Swiss government"".
In 2006, the World Bank was involved in a similar framework, providing institutional support for the return and use of approx. $723 million in public funds that had been corruptly diverted by General Abacha. See case entry ARW-167 and the attached World Bank Fact Sheet. ",

	According to the Agreed Final Judgment of Forfeiture filed on January 15, 2015 in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the assets were forfeited to the United States, including after Mr. Villareal Hernandez agreed to the forfeiture.  (Source:  US v. All Funds on Deposit At Sun Secured Advantage Account Number 26-2673-031320, Case No. 2:13-cv-00033 (S.D. Tex)).  

	 

	According to the US Department of Justice Press Release dated February 6, 2013, ""The United States has seized a bank account located in Bermuda alleged to have been owned by former State of Coahuila, Mexico, Secretary of Finance Hector Javier Villareal Hernandez [  ].  The account, which is held in Bermuda, Sun Secured Advantage account at N.T. Butterfield and Son Limited, contained $2,275,544.41 as of Jan. 4, 2013. The government alleged, as its basis for forfeiture, that the funds in the account were involved in a money laundering transaction, that the property constitutes or was derived from proceeds traceable to offenses including bribery of a public official, or the misappropriation, theft or embezzlement of public funds by or for the benefit of a public official. [  ] 

	 

	In approximately December 2005, Hernandez was appointed by then Governor of Coahuila Humberto Moreira to the position of Under Secretary of Program and Budget for Coahuila. In July 2008, Hernandez was appointed by the same governor to the position of Secretary of Finance for Coahuila. On Aug. 19, 2011, Hernandez resigned that position and became a subject of investigation by the government of Mexico. On Oct. 28, 2011, a local judge from Coahuila charged Hernandez with forging state documents to obtain fraudulent loans for several million pesos between 2008 and 2011. On Oct. 29, 2011, Hernandez was arrested and released on bond. He later fled and remains a fugitive on those charges.

	 

	According to the civil complaint, in 2011, Mexican law enforcement officials initiated an investigation involving fraudulent loans obtained from Mexican banks by Hernandez while he held the position of Secretary of Finance. The investigation includes three fraudulent loans from two different Mexican banks from July 2010 to March 2011 totaling more than $3 billion Mexican Pesos ($246 million U.S. dollars based on exchange rates on the dates of the loans). On Feb. 3 and March 8, 2012, Mexican government authorities filed false loan charges and issued arrest warrants for Hernandez’s involvement in the false loans with two Mexican banks. The charges allege Hernandez and other co-conspirators acquired loans by providing false information to Mexican banks. The false information involved the use of false registry stamps or previously approved registry stamps used on the false loan contracts. 

	 

	The conspiracy is alleged in the complaint to have begun when Hernandez requested a loan on behalf of the State of Coahuila. He then drafted and submitted a false loan contract for approval by the federal Treasury Department. Hernandez conspired to falsify the approval of the submitted loan contract. His alleged co-conspirators, who worked at the federal Treasury Department, placed a fraudulent federal registry stamp or a previously approved registry stamp on the loan contract to make it appear that the loan contract had been approved. After the loan contract obtained the false registry stamp or previously approved registry stamp and received ""approval,"" the contract was submitted to a Mexican federal bank for issuance of a loan to the State of Coahuila. Once the loan proceeds were obtained, they were available for use by the State of Coahuila. [ ] 

	 

	Hernandez opened an offshore investment account in Bermuda during this time period. Since April 2009, it is estimated that Hernandez and his associates received more than $35 million through foreign exchange transactions and cross border wires and subsequently purchased numerous real properties in San Antonio, Brownsville and South Padre Island with the illegal proceeds.""  (Source:  The United States Attorney's Office - Southern District of Texas, ""Bermuda Bank Account Allegedly Owned by Former Mexican Secretary of Finance Seized by US,"" February 6, 2013.)

Hawaii), Order of Settlement filed October 29, 2013). 
	 
	According to a statement by the lawyers representing the Marcos era human rights victims, ""Filipinos tortured, summarily executed or who disappeared during the Marcos regime may soon receive a second distribution.  Robert Swift, lead counsel for the 10,000 Filipino victims human rights abuses, announced a $10 million settlement over artwork owned by Imelda Marcos.  The settlement derives from litigation in New York City by the victims to recover on their judgments against the Marcoses.
	 
	Immediately after the Marcoses fled to Hawaii in February 1986, more than 200 pieces of artwork purchased by Imelda Marcos disappeared from the Marcoses townhouse in New York.  In 2010, the New York District Attorney indicted a former assistant to Imelda Marcos, Vilma Bautista, for the illegal sale of one of the paintings, an impressionist masterpiece by Claude Monet.  The District Attorney also recovered $15 million from the sale as well as three other valuable artworks.  Class counsel, who obtained a contempt judgment against Imelda Marcos and Senator Ferdinand R. Marcos for $353.6 million, immediately filed suit in New York to recover the paintings and the proceeds.  The $10 million settlement was paid by the current owner of the Monet painting, a good faith purchaser of that artwork.  The victims continue to sue all others involved in the sale of the painting.
	 
	Robert Swift commented: “With this settlement, the Class is just starting to recover on its judgment.  The Marcoses have hidden many of their assets and prevented the victims from making any significant recovery on their original 1995 judgment of $2 billion.  It is poetic justice that the victims are benefitting from a valuable painting that Imelda Marcos purchased and revered.  The Marcoses have thumbed their noses at the United States court and Filipino victims of  human rights violations ever since the original judgment was entered.  They were caught trying to dissipate the Marcos Estate’s assets to re-capitalize their political dynasty in the Philippines.  This New York litigation may be the vehicle to discover the totality of the Marcos artwork trove and to recover still more money for the victims.”

Domingo, Jr. said “the recovery of $10 million will be welcome news to the victims, most of whom are now aged and poor.  The first distribution of $1,000 to each victim in 2011 was greeted joyously.  We anticipate a second distribution in early 2014 when perhaps even more money will have been recovered.”  The approval of the settlement is pending before Judge Manuel Real of the Federal Court in Hawaii.  Any distribution must be approved by the Court.""  (Source:  Class Suit Lawyers Statement on Monet Painting Recovery, Press Statement, Re: Marcos Human Rights Litigation, July 18, 2013.)"," A trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on criminal racketeering and fraud charges concluded in an acquittal for Mrs. Marcos.  Mr. Marcos had also been indicted in the case, but the court had deemed him too ill to stand trial.

	On November 20, 2012, the District Attorney for New York County, New York, announced the indictment of ""VILMA BAUTISTA, 74, CHAIYOT JANSEN NAVALAKSANA (“JANSEN”), 37, and PONGSAK NAVALAKSANA (“PONGSAK”), 40, for illegally conspiring to possess and sell valuable works of art acquired by former First Lady of the Philippines Imelda Marcos during her husband’s presidency, keeping the proceeds for themselves, and hiding those proceeds from New York State tax authorities and others. The art included a Claude Monet “Water-Lily” painting, which the defendants sold in September 2010 for $32 million. The indictment charges all three defendants with Conspiracy in the Fourth Degree, and also charges BAUTISTA with Criminal Tax Fraud in the First Degree and Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree. JANSEN is charged with Criminal Tax Fraud in the Fourth Degree and Offering a False Instrument for Filing in the First Degree. [ ]   

	According to the indictment, BAUTISTA was employed by the Philippine government as a Foreign Service Officer assigned to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations in New York from the early 1970s through approximately 1986. During that period and for years after, BAUTISTA unofficially acted as the New York-based personal secretary of Imelda Marcos, whose husband, Ferdinand Marcos, now deceased, served as President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. During her husband’s presidency, Imelda Marcos used state assets to acquire a vast collection of artwork and other valuables. Much of the art adorned official Philippine government property in the Philippines and Manhattan. Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos fled the Philippines in February 1986 following a popular revolt.

	 

	In the period of time immediately before and after the fall of the Marcos regime, a significant amount of artwork and other valuables disappeared from Philippine government property, including from the Philippine Consulate townhouse in Manhattan. Since then, the Philippine government has engaged in a public campaign to recover missing and stolen property acquired by the Marcoses. BAUTISTA is accused of having been aware of and monitoring this campaign, even as she possessed some of the valuable works of art.""  (Source:  New York County District Attorney's Office Press Release, ""DA Vance:  Three Individuals Charged in Conspiracy Involving Monet Artworks that Disappeared with the Collapse of the Marcos Regime in the Philippines,"" November 20, 2012.)    ","A trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on criminal racketeering and fraud charges concluded in an acquittal for Mrs. Marcos.  Mr. Marcos had also been indicted in the case, but the court had deemed him too ill to stand trial.

	As summarized in an article by Edwards Wildman Palmer attorneys, ""On 28 May 2013, the EU General Court (“the Court”), attached to the European Court of Justice, gave three judgments in Cases T-187/11 Trabelsi, T-188/11 Chiboub and T-200/11 Al Matri, in which it annulled the sanctions listing of three relatives of former President Ben Ali of Tunisia.

	 

	Mr Al Matri and Mr Chiboub are the sons-in-law of former President Ben Ali and Mr Mohamed Trabelsi is the nephew of his wife. The three individuals and other persons connected to Mr Trabelsi brought proceedings contesting the freezing of their assets pursuant to Council Decisions 2011/72/CFSP and 2011/79/CFSP.

	 

	The Court reached similar conclusions in each of the three cases annulling the sanctions. In reaching a decision, the Court noted that Article 1(1) of 2011/72/CFSP required that only persons “responsible for misappropriation of Tunisian State funds” and those associated with them may be subject to an asset freeze, while Decision 2011/79/CFSP froze the assets of the applicants on the basis that they were subject to “judicial investigation by the Tunisian authorities in respect of the acquisition of movable and immovable property, the opening of bank accounts and the holding of financial assets in several countries as part of money laundering operations.”

	 

	The Court held that the Council had not established that under Tunisian law, “misappropriation of public funds” encompassed “money laundering” (offences for which the Tunisian authorities were stated to be investigating the applicants). The Court held that the Council had not established that the investigations had been launched in relation to the laundering of public rather than private funds. The Court further held that the fact that the applicants were related to Ben Ali was not sufficient to imply that the money laundering investigations related to the misappropriation of state funds, since there was no such presumption in any of the legislation.

	 

	In all three cases, the Court annulled Decision 2011/79/CFSP insofar as it related to them. The funds will not be immediately released because the European Council has two months to challenge the decision. If this does not happen, the freeze will end.""

The indictment alleged that, ""The object of the conspiracy was to steal money from the City of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to possess the money in Brazil, New York and elsewhere, and to conceal the existence of the conspiracy and the location of the stolen money. To do this, the conspirators perpetrated an over-invoicing and kick-back scheme involving the municipal construction of an arterial highway in Sao Paulo known as the Avenida Agua Espraiada project. In the course of the conspiracy, stolen proceeds were transferred to a bank account in New York County and, from New York County, to a bank account located in the Bailiwick of Jersey in the Channel Islands. The conspirators also used the bank account in New York County to return stolen proceeds to Brazil, to buy personal items, and to pay for expenses related to Brazilian political campaigns.  During the period from on or about January 1993 to on or about December 1996, PAULO MALUF was Mayor of Sao Paulo.

Daniel Arap Moi / Anglo-Leasing Case / First Mercantile Securities Corporation,Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission,"Art.17, Art.19, Art.23",Yes,Actions Initiated by Foreign Jurisdiction; Domestic Criminal Investigation,Ongoing Case,,"In June 2014, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland announced that ""as part of its own criminal investigation into the Anglo Leasing case, [the OAG] has requested support from the Kenyan judicial authorities to obtain evidence of a possible predicate offence to money laundering.
Companies based in Switzerland are suspected of being involved in the Kenyan Anglo Leasing scandal and related assets are believed to have been moved to Switzerland. This is the starting point for the OAG's criminal proceedings against three suspects, which began in April 2009 following a report from the Money Laundering Reporting Office (MROS).
Since then, the OAG has successfully identified and frozen several bank accounts in Switzerland. Financial transfers were assessed and the results of the comprehensive cash flow analysis of cross-border links led the OAG to request mutual legal assistance from various states. England, Scotland and Jersey have already provided the OAG with a considerable amount of useful information.
The OAG is now requesting Kenya for active mutual legal assistance in order to obtain evidence of the predicate offence committed outside Switzerland. The suspected predicate offence to money laundering is the alleged bribery of Kenyan public officials in return for the award of lucrative government contracts. The OAG has requested the transmission of evidence obtained in the course of the Kenyan criminal proceedings in the Anglo Leasing scandal. Assistance from the Kenyan judicial authorities is therefore essential and their contribution will be decisive to the success of the Swiss criminal investigation.
The OAG has previously granted mutual legal assistance to Kenya, providing the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission with documents on Swiss links to the Anglo Leasing affair and on the associated funds that were identified in Switzerland (See OAG press release dated 20.09.2012: https://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?long=de&msg-id=46040)."" (Source: Switzerland, Office of the Attorney General Media Releases:  ""Anglo Leasing affair: Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland requests Kenya for mutual legal assistance,"" June 20, 2014.)
On July 16, 2010, in the matter between the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and First Mercantile Securities Corporation, the Court of Appeal of Kenya at Nairobi set aside a ruling by the lower court which had permitted First Mercantile to have set aside the request for mutual legal assistance made by the anti-corruption agency to the Swiss authorities in connection with its investigation into the Anglo-Leasing scandal.  (Source: Between Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission and First Mercantile Securities Corporation, In H.C. Misc. C.C. No. 695 of 2007, Civil Appeal 194 of 2008, July 16, 2010).   As explained in the court's judgment, on July 22, 2002, the Government of Kenya entered into an US$811,787,000 agreement with First Mercantile Securities Corporation.  The Postal Corporation of Kenya had wanted to purchase telecommunications equipment from an American company, but neither the Government of Kenya or the Postal Corporation could immediately pay the $811 million in lump sum.  The court then writes ""But for some unexplained reason"" instead of the Postal Corporation, the Government of Kenya entered into a contract with First Mercantile to finance the purchase.  The 2002 contract required the Government to make installment payments to First Mercantile.  In 2003, the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act came into force and established the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission.  According to the Court, the Government of Kenya made payments to First Mercantile up to June 14, 2004, leaving an outstanding balance of US $5,936,910.09, when ""For some reason or reasons which we need not concern ourselves with the in the judgment, GOK [Government of Kenya] thereafter refused to pay any further instalments. We only need to point out that this agreement is one of those now notoriously referred to in Kenya as the Anglo-Leasing Scandal.  when it stopped the payments.""  In December 2005, First Mercantile sued the Kenyan government for unpaid sums.  In May 2007, the Director of the Kenyan Anti-Corruption Commission sent a letter of request to the Federal Office of Justice and Police Section of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which stated that the Commission ""is investigating in the present case serious criminal offences which include breach of laws, procedures and regulations, corrupt transactions with agents, in which Government of Kenya officials acting on false and or fradulent information, awarded a contract for US$12.8 million.  About US$6.8 million was paid out to First Mercantile Securities Corporation, Tortala, Succursale de Geneva, a subsidiary of First Mercantile Securities Corporation, British Virgin Islands...to Swiss Bank Accounts which is the reason for the present request for MLA is make to Swiss Authorities.""  A month after the request was made, the company filed suit in June 2007, in the High Court in Nairobi to seek an order to prohibit the Anti-Corruption Commission's mutual legal assistance request and to stay enforcement of the letter of request for assistance.  The High Court granted leave which also operated as a stay on the assistance request.   The Court of Appeals reversed, writing, in part, that the Anti-Corruption Commission is independent of the Government of Kenya and that it ""can investigate GOK [Government of Kenya] officials if they are suspected to have been involved in corrupt practices or to have committed economic crimes.""  Moreover, it was up to the Swiss government to  agree to the request or not.  The Court stated that one of the grounds presented by the Commission as the basis for its mutual legal assistance request was that Kenya was a signatory to the United Nations Convention on Corruption.  The Court wrote, ""We have already held that the Appellant [Anti-Corruption Commission] was entitled to issue the LMA [Letter for Mutual Assistance]  under section 12(3) of its creating statute and we see no reason to go into the question on principles of international law.""

(Award of September 25, 2006, at 49).  The Tribunal also held that ""Mr. Ali's payment was received corruptly by the Kenyan head of state; it was a covert bribe; and accordingly its receipt is not legally to be imputed to Kenya itself."" (Award of September 25, 2006, at 54).",,"According to the December 2010 Asset Recovery Handbook by the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, ""In 1989, Kenya initially entered into an agreement with World Duty Free Company (WDF) for construction, maintenance, and operation of duty-free complexes at Nairobi and Mombasa international airports.  In obtaining the contract, WDF paid bribes to the former Kenyan president, Daniel arap Moi. Subsequently, in 1998, WDF was placed under receivership by the High Court in Kenya; and a formal judgment and decree was made in 2001, transferring beneficial ownership to the receiver.  In disputing the order before the ICSID, WDF claimed that Kenya had unlawfully destroyed its contractual rights through the receivership order. The government of Kenya argued that WDF's procurement of the agreement through bribes was a breach of English and Kenyan laws applicable to the contract, as well as breach of international public policy, and that the government was lawfully entitled to avoid contract obligations."" (Source:  Asset Recovery Handbook (Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, December 2010) at 167).  The Arbitration Tribunal noted that ""former President of Kenya, Mr. Daniel arap Moi, was not a party to these arbitration proceedings and was not legally represented in these proceedings.  He was not heard as a witness... The Tribunal decided on the dispute submitted to it on the evidence adduced and the submissions made by the parties to the case.""  (Source: In the Proceeding Between World Duty Free Company Limited and The Republic of Kenya, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award of September 25, 2006.)   World Duty Free Company Limited, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, had requested the arbitration on June 16, 2000.  The request was registered by the ICSID purusant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.   World Duty Free was managed by Mr. Nasir Ibrahim Ali; in 1991, the Al-Ghurair family which had owned WDF sold its shares and as a result, Mr. Ali held in his own name 10% of the World Duty Free shares and 90% of the stock was registered in the name of Dinky International SA, whose shareholders were Mr. Ali at 90% and rest owned by his wife.  Mr. Ali's $2 million payment to then President Moi is described in his written statement to the Tribunal (Award of September 25, 2006, at 37-38.)  The Tribunal wrote, ""It remains nonetheless a highly disturbing feature in this case that the corrupt recipient of the Claimant's bribe was more than an officer of the State but its most senior officer, the Kenyan President; and that it is Kenya which is here advancing as a complete defence to the Claimant's [World Duty Free's] claims the illegalities of its own former President.  Moreover, on the evidence before this Tribunal, the bribe was apparently solicited by the Kenyan President and not wholly initiated by the Claimant.  Although the Kenyan President has now left office and is no longer immune from suit under the Kenyan Constitution, it appears that no attempt has been made by Kenya to prosecute him for corruption or to recover the bribe in civil proceedings.""

The Phillippines had to provide an assurance that the confiscation or repayment of the assets in question would be handled through judicial proceedings that complied with the principles of the International Civil and Political Rights Pact, and the Phillippine government also had to undertake to brief the Swiss authorities regularly on the judicial confiscation and repayment proceedings, as well as on the precautions and procedures pertaining to compensation for victims of violations of human rights under the Marcos regime. /  No further decision required from Swiss authorities / Once the Federal Office of Justice (at the time: the Federal Office of Police Matters) had declared the guarantee given by the Phillippines to be satisfactory and the Swiss Federal Supreme Court had dismissed appeals against the ruling, the assets could be transferred in 1998 to a escrow account with the Phillippine National Bank in Manila. Following the confiscation ruling of the Phillippine Supreme Court on 15 July 2003, which confirmed the view of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court with regard to the criminal origin of the monies seized, the Phillippine government may now dispose of the assets, worth some USD 683 million.

Moreover, the level of corruption of the Haitian state was notoriously high during the period in which they had held public office.

The defendant company received and held the proceeds of criminal conduct perpetrated by its controlling mind and beneficial owner, Samuel Gichuru. The company knowingly enabled Gichuru to obtain substantial bribes paid to him while he held public office in Kenya. The company played a vital role without which corruption on a grand scale is impossible: money laundering. 
2. Gichuru was the chief executive of Kenya’s power utility, the Kenya Power & Lighting Company (“KPLC”) from November 1984 until February 2003. He accepted bribes from foreign businesses that contracted with that company during his term of office and hid them in Jersey.""

He also stated that the account was opened for the receipt of fees which he earned from business introductions and as a consultant.  In about 1986, he was advised by the Jersey office of Deloitte & Touche (forerunner to the respondents, ""Walbrook"") that his needs would be better served by having a company. Accordingly in August 1986 Windward Trading Limited was incorporated in Jersey. Walbrook is the administrator of Windward and provides its directors and secretary.  Windward had bank accounts with HSBC Bank Plc and the Royal bank of Scotland International Limited, to which Walbrook provided signatories to the accounts.  The Court stated that Mr. Gichuru is the beneficial owner of Windward and the various Walbrook entities hold the shares as nominees for him. In May 2002, Walbrook filed a Suspicious Activity Report with the police and the police did not give consent to Walbrook making any payments and Walbrook refused to make any payments from Windward to Mr. Gichuru since then.  On August 21, 2003, a notice under the Investigation of Fraud (Jersey) Law 1990 was issued by the Attorney General demaning documents and information.
