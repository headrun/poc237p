In the opinion of the OAG, Alstom SA as the senior holding company is responsible in part for the organizational deficiencies identified. However, after payment of CHF 1 m as reparation and bearing the remaining costs of the proceedings by Alstom SA, the OAG refrained from sanctioning Alstom SA in addition to Alstom Network Schweiz AG regarding the established acts of bribery. It did so particularly considering the demonstrated willingness to cooperate and the considerable improvements in the internal compliance procedures before and after the opening of the investigations.Within the proceedings against Alstom Network Schweiz AG and Alstom SA, the OAG in close cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police investigated further twelve projects in the power station sector, divided over all continents. In this regard, it in some part detected additional breaches of internal compliance regulations. Despite considerable investigative efforts however, no additional acts of bribery could be established for the time after article 102 SCC had come into effect. The proceedings against the two defendant Alstom entities for these additionally investigated twelve projects were dismissed due to the lack of any criminal conduct (Art. 319(1)(a) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure) and due to the lack of criminal liability of the companies prior to October 2003 (Art. 319(1)(b) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure), without granting compensation and by imposing the costs m paid by Alstom SA as reparation under Art. 53 SCC was transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

At the time, the Indonesian government required an environmental impact study before authorizing the cultivation of genetically modified crops. After a change in governments in Indonesia, Monsanto sought, unsuccessfully, to have the new government, in which the senior environment official had a post, amend or repeal the requirement for the environmental impact statement. Having failed to obtain the senior environment official's agreement to amend or repeal this requirement, in 2002, Charles Martin, the Government Affairs Director for Asia for Monsanto, authorized and directed an Indonesian consulting firm to make an illegal payment totaling $50,000 to the senior environment official to ""incentivize"" him to agree to do so. Martin also directed representatives of the Indonesian consulting company to submit false invoices to Monsanto for ""consultant fees"" to obtain reimbursement for the bribe, and agreed to pay the consulting company for taxes that company would owe by reporting income from the ""consultant fees."" In February 2002, an employee of the Indonesian consulting company delivered $50,000 in cash to the senior environment official, explaining that Monsanto wanted to do something for him in exchange for repealing the environmental impact study requirement. The senior environment official promised that he would do so at an appropriate time. In March 2002, Monsanto, through its Indonesian subsidiary, paid the false invoices thus reimbursing the consulting company for the $50,000 bribe, as well as the tax it owed on that income. A false entry for these ""consulting services"" was included in Monsanto's books and records. The senior environment official never authorized the repeal of the environmental impact study requirement.""

https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/printpdf/20108,Midway Trading,Iraq (UN Oil-for-Food),Criminal,Criminal Fine,Grand Larceny,"According to the New York County District Attorney's Office Press Release on October 20, 2005, ""Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau announced today the guilty plea of https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-caseshttps://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/articleglossary/#Art.16https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/articleglossary/#Art.26a Reston, Virginia-based oil trading company for its involvement in a scheme to pay kickbacks to Iraq in connection with oil purchases made under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program. MIDWAY TRADING (MIDWAY) pleaded guilty in New York State Court to Grand Larceny in the First Degree in connection with the scheme. According to the charges, Midway and one of its trading partners, Bulf Oil, paid more than $440,000 in kickbacks to Iraqi officials in connection with oil purchases but falsely represented to the United Nations that no kickbacks were paid. Relying on those false representations, United Nations officials approved the contracts and authorized millions of dollars in payments for the benefit of Iraq from the Oil-for-Food Program. MIDWAY will pay a fine of $250,000, with $100,000 due by December 1, 2005. The plea by MIDWAY is part of a continuing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into the Oil-for-Food Program. This investigation began as a result of this office's cooperation with the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-that in late 2000, the company purchased the right to lift oil from Iraq under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program from Bulf Oil, a Romanian oil company. Under United Nations resolutions, all money paid for the purchase of Iraqi crude oil was deposited into a UN trust account at a branch of BNP Paribas, a French bank, in Manhattan. Payments from the trust account, including payments for so-called ""humanitarian goods"" to be sent to Iraq, had to be authorized by United Nations officials. No money for the purchase of crude oil from Iraq was to go directly to Iraq. Under its initial $42 million agreement with Bulf, MIDWAY was to provide financing for the purchase cost of the Iraqi crude oil and to share any profits from MIDWAY's subsequent sale of that crude oil. An employee of Bulf Oil asked MIDWAY to pay him an additional 25 cents per barrel, an extra payment that MIDWAY did not make, at first. MIDWAY sold the Iraqi crude oil lift to Texaco Corp., which, in turn, sold the crude oil lift to British Petroleum ('BP'). MIDWAY provided BP with a price guarantee. On March 28, 2001, a ship chartered by BP arrived at the Turkish Port of Ceyhan, but was not allowed to lift the oil. On April 1, 2001, MIDWAY wired $225,000 from an account at SunTrust Bank in Virginia to the Jordan National Bank's correspondent bank account at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York for the benefit of an account in name of the Bulf employee. The $225,000 was the approximate equivalent of the 25 cent per barrel kickback that the Bulf employee had asked for. On April 2nd and 3rd, the oil was loaded onto BP's ship. MIDWAY later learned that the money wired to the Jordan National Bank was for the benefit of Iraqi government officials and that the 'surcharge' had to be paid as a precondition for oil to be loaded. As a consequence of the price guarantee given to BP and the delay in lifting the oil, MIDWAY lost $ 1 million on this initial transaction. In September, 2001, MIDWAY acquired the remainder of Bulf Oil's allocation of oil, at a purchase price of $22 million, under the Oil-for-Food Program. This time, prior to the lift of oil, MIDWAY wired $215,442.25 to Jordan National Bank's correspondent account at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York in the name of an agent of MIDWAY's. Midway knew that, as in the first transaction, the money wired to the Jordan National Bank account was, in fact, a kickback to be paid to Iraqi officials, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 986. MIDWAY did not inform the UN about its payment to the Jordan National Bank. And, as MIDWAY knew, Bulf Oil's contract for the purchase of Iraqi oil falsely represented that all of the United Nations Security Council resolutions had been complied with. The second lift went smoothly and Midway profited approximately $375,000 from the sale of the crude oil. The contract purchase price for the oil, $22 million, was paid into the United Nations trust account for the Oil-for-Food Program.

Bourke Jr., and David Pinkerton were indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Travel Act, substantive FCPA violations, substantive Travel Act Violations, conspiracy to commit money laundering, substantive money laundering charges, and, in the case of Bourke and Pinkerton, making false statements. These charges stemmed from their role in a scheme to pay millions of dollars worth of bribes to Azeri government officials to ensure that the defendants' investment consortium would gain, in secret partnership with the Azeri officials, a controlling interest in the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and its substantial oil reserves. According to evidence presented in the trial of Bourke, in August 1997, Kozeny allegedly agreed to transfer to corrupt Azeri officials two-thirds of the vouchers and options purchased by his investment consortium, Oily Rock, and to give them two-thirds of all of the profits arising from his investment consortium's participation in SOCAR's privatization. In addition, evidence presented at trial showed that in June 1998, Bourke knew that Kozeny arranged for Oily Rock to increase its authorized share capital from $150 million to $450 million so that the additional $300 million worth of Oily Rock shares could be transferred to one or more of the Azeri officials as a further bribe payment. Bourke also arranged for two of the corrupt officials to travel to New York City on different occasions in 1998 to receive medical treatment, for which Oily Rock paid. Thereafter, in interviews with the FBI in April and May of 2002, Bourke falsely stated that he was not aware that Kozeny had made the alleged payments to the Azeri Officials. Three others have been charged in connection with their roles in this bribery scheme. Thomas Farrell, a former employee of Oily Rock, was charged in an information with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions. On July 31, 2003, Clayton Lewis, a former principal of Omega Advisors and a co-investor in the scheme, was indicted on one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. On August 5, 2003, a grand jury in New York returned an indictment charging the third individual, Hans Bodmer, a Swiss lawyer who represented Kozeny and his investment consortium, with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions and conspiracy to commit money laundering.

According to court documents, between 2001 and 2003, a Jordan-based agent acting on behalf of Novo, an international manufacturer of insulin, medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies, made improper payments worth approximately $1.4 million to the former Iraqi government in order to obtain contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health to provide insulin and other medicines as part of the Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP).Novo engaged its long-time Jordan-based agent to submit bids on Novo's behalf to Kimadia, the Iraqi State Company for the Importation and Distribution of Drugs and Medical Appliances, a state-owned company which was part of the Iraqi Ministry of Health. Two branches of Novo Nordisk - RONE, based in Athens, Greece, and NEO, based in Amman, Jordan - handled the sales to the Iraq and supplied the agent with bid prices for each contract.

Examination of the accounting records of the companies operating the hotels showed in particular that CHF 48 000 had been paid in 2006-07 so that representatives of Office XY would stay in these establishments; that CHF 27 100 had been paid between 2003 and 2007 so that customers from consulate XY and permanent mission XY would stay there; and that CHF 34 000 had been paid so that customers connected with mission XY would stay there. The investigation determined that the payment of these commissions had enabled the hotels in question to generate turnover of CHF 1.5 million (or approximately EUR 1.2 million). When questioned by the Geneva law enforcement authorities, the defendant acknowledged having paid commissions to attract customers, while contending that the customers brought in by the commissions had not, in his opinion, been members of official representations. The prosecutor in the case deemed, however, that a review of the accounting documents in evidence clearly showed that the customers were in fact official representatives, that a 2009 letter clearly indicated that the accused habitually paid commissions to foreign officials and lastly, that it made little difference whether the intermediaries receiving the commissions did not work formally for the various foreign missions insofar as a purpose of the commissions was to attract diplomatic clientele. The Geneva law enforcement authorities also rejected the defendant?s contention that the payment of commissions to foreign public officials was a recurring practice in the hotel industry. After taking account of the defendant's lack of a criminal record and his personal and economic circumstances, and considering that the deeds of which he was accused were not serious enough to take the accused to trial, X was sentenced by Summary punishment order to a suspended fine of CHF 49 500 (approximately EUR 41 000), three years? probation and a fine of CHF 12 000 (approximately EUR 10 000).""

Following a series of negotiations with the Iranian official in 2001 and 2002, Statoil entered into a -- consulting contract? with an offshore intermediary company. The purpose of that consulting contract -- which called for the payment of more than $15 million over 11 years -- was to induce the Iranian official to use his influence to assist Statoil in obtaining a contract to develop portions of the South Pars field and to open doors to additional Iranian oil and gas projects in the future. Two bribe payments totaling more than $5 million were actually made by wire transfer through a New York bank account, and Statoil was awarded a South Pars development contract that was expected to yield millions of dollars in profit.""

As a result of its guilty plea, VITOL will pay restitution of $13 million to the Iraqi people through the Development Fund for Iraq and a payment of $4.5 million in lieu of fines, forfeiture and to cover the cost of prosecution. The plea by VITOL is part of a continuing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into the Oil-for-Food Programme. This investigation began as a result of this office's cooperation with the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme, headed by Paul Volcker. Mr. Morgenthau said, 'The Oil for Food Programme was established by the United Nations with the noble goal of providing for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. One outcome of this investigation, and last week's joint investigation involving Chevron, is to insure that illegal funds that were paid to Saddam Hussein's government are redirected to benefit the Iraqi people.' Through its representative, duly appointed by Vitol's Board of Directors, VITOL admitted in court today that while the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme was in effect, VITOL purchased Iraqi crude oil first as a direct purchaser and later from third-parties. In June 2001, after an OPEC meeting, an agent of VITOL was told by Iraqi officials that surcharges had to be paid in order for Iraqi crude oil to be lifted. Over the next year, VITOL paid or caused surcharges to be paid on certain oil purchases in two ways. In direct purchases, VITOL had an associated entity called Vitol Bahrain send the surcharge monies to accounts controlled by the Iraqi regime. In indirect purchases, VITOL financed the purchase of oil through third-parties who then paid the surcharge to the Iraqi regime. VITOL did not inform the UN about the surcharge payments. During the period from June 2001 through September 2002, approximately $13,000,000 in surcharge monies were paid directly to the Iraqi regime in connection with crude oil purchased directly or indirectly by VITOL. The investigation into the United Nations? Oil-for-Food Programme has resulted into two other actions against oil companies. Last week, there was a settlement with the Chevron Oil Company in which Chevron paid $27 million, of which $20 million was paid as restitution for the benefit of the Iraqi people. In October 2005, Midway Trading pleaded guilty for paying kickbacks to Iraq for oil purchases."" Mr. Morgenthau thanked the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme and Paul Volcker who heads the Committee.

This outcome follows a settlement by BAE as part of a global agreement it reached earlier this year with the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzania contract whereby BAE agreed to pay an ex-gratia payment for the benefit of the people of Tanzania of £40 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court. of a radar defence system for Dar-es-Salaam International Airport was agreed in 1999 between British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd and the government of Tanzania. (This followed negotiations that had been conducted since 1992 initially by Siemens Plessey Systems which was acquired by BAE in 1998). The value of the contract was US $39.97 million. BAE's practice was to engage advisers to help with its marketing. These advisers were either classified by BAE as 'overt' (i.e. that is they operated openly as BAE's in-country representatives), or 'covert'. The latter operated in circumstances where there was a need for confidentiality. In order to maximise confidentiality with regard to its use of covert advisers and the making of payments to them, BAE set up Red Diamond Trading Company, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. In Tanzania a local businessman, Shailesh Vithlani, was recruited at an early stage (initially by Siemens) to advise BAE on its negotiations with the government on the radar contract. Shortly before the contract was signed two new adviser arrangements with Vithlani were concluded. One was made between Red Diamond and a Vithlani-controlled Panama-incorporated company, Envers Trading Corporation. This was a 'covert' arrangement where the fee for Vithlani's services was to be not more than 30.025% of the radar contract price. The other arrangement was 'overt' and was for services direct to BAE by a Vithlani-controlled business, Merlin International, registered in the B.V.I. It did not involve Red Diamond and the fee was 1% of the radar contract value. Between January 2000 and December 2005 around $12.4 million was paid to Vithlani's two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations. The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review. Furthermore, it was not possible for any person auditing the accounts to investigate and determine whether the payments were properly accounted for or were lawful. In sentencing BAE, the Judge said that he took the view that BAE were concealing from the auditors and ultimately the public the fact that they were making payments to Vithlani; 97% of them via two offshore companies, with the intention that he should have free rein to make such payments to such people as he thought fit in order to secure the radar contract for BAE but that BAE did not want to know the details. The Judge took into account in sentencing BAE that the group had committed itself to a process of change following the Report of Lord Woolf and that BAE would be making a payment for the benefit of the people of Tanzania of £40 million less the fine.

""This matter concerns BHPB?s failure to devise and maintain sufficient internal controls over a global hospitality program that the company hosted in connection with its sponsorship of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games. BHPB invited approximately 176 government officials and employees of state-owned enterprises (collectively, ?government officials?) to attend the Olympics at BHPB?s expense. The majority of these invitations were extended to government officials from countries in Africa and Asia that had well-known histories of corruption. The three to four day hospitality packages included event tickets, luxury hotel accommodations, meals, other hospitality, and, in many instances, offers of business-class airfare for stakeholders, e.g.: Government Ministers, Suppliers and Customers,? and that the hospitality program was ?a primary vehicle to ensure this goal is achieved.? 2. BHPB recognized that inviting government officials to the Olympics created a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws and the company?s own Guide to Business Conduct, but the internal controls it developed and relied upon in an effort to address this risk were insufficient. As a result, BHPB invited government officials who were directly involved in, or in a position to influence, pending contract negotiations, efforts to obtain access rights, regulatory actions, or business dealings affecting BHPB in multiple countries. In addition, BHPB?s books and records, namely certain internal forms that employees prepared in order to invite a government official to the Olympics, did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect BHPB?s pending negotiations or business dealings with the government official at the time of the invitation.""

Besso is the broking subsidiary of Besso Insurance Group Limited. Besso is a medium-sized Lloyd?s general insurance broker operating mainly in the commercial sector, specialising in marine, aviation, transport, property, casualty, international and liability insurance. Besso has been authorised by the Authority to carry out a number of regulated activities since 14 January 2005. This includes assisting in the administration and performance of contracts of insurance. 4.2. Insurance and reinsurance brokers such as Besso make payments to, and share commission with, Third Parties in a number of circumstances. For example, a broker may pay a co-broker who assists in the placement of insurance or reinsurance. In some cases, a broker may pay a broker who provides services (e.g., administrative and policy insurance services) in relation to the placement of insurance in countries where the principal broker does not have an office. In other cases, a broker may pay individuals or companies who have limited or no involvement in placement activities, but assist with client introductions and providing relevant market and other information. 4.3. Being a wholesale broker, Besso was heavily reliant upon Producing Brokers to bring business to it. The Producing Brokers would have the relationship with the insured and would handle all correspondence in relation to that insured. Besso would normally agree a split of commission between the Producing Broker and itself. 4.4. During the Relevant Period, Besso offered (and continues to offer) broking services for both insurance and reinsurance business across a wide range of industries and countries, which will have had a varying degree of perceived risk of bribery and corruption. In establishing and maintaining business relationships, Besso made use of, and paid commissions to, Third Parties (both overseas and in the UK). Accordingly, although it was not unusual or inappropriate for Besso to make payments to Third Parties, there was a risk, which was increased for higher risk industries and countries, that a proportion of the money paid to Third Parties might have been used by the Third Parties for inappropriate purposes. This could have included paying bribes to persons connected with the insured or public officials."" (Source: UK FCA FInal Notice, File Reference Number 309159, March 17, 2014.)"

Not only was that project itself worth more than $100 million, but HP Russia viewed it as the ?golden key? that could unlock the door to another $100 to $150 million dollars in business with Russian government agencies. To secure a contract for the first phase of project, ultimately valued at more than € 35 million, HP Russia executives and other employees structured the deal to create a secret slush fund totaling several million dollars, at least part of which was intended for bribes to Russian government officials. As admitted in a statement of facts, HP Russia created excess profit margins for the slush fund through an elaborate buyback deal structure, whereby (1) HP sold the computer hardware and other technology products called for under the contract to a Russian channel partner, (2) HP bought the same products back from an intermediary company at a nearly €8 million markup and paid the intermediary an additional €4.2 million for purported services, and (3) HP sold the same products to the GPO at the increased price. The payments to the intermediary were then largely transferred through a cascading series of shell companies ? some of which were directly associated with government officials ? registered in the United States, United Kingdom, British Virgin Islands and Belize. Much of these payments from the intermediary were laundered through offshore bank accounts in Switzerland, Lithuania, Latvia and Austria. Portions of the funds were spent on travel, cars, jewelry, clothing, expensive watches, swimming pool technology, furniture, household appliances and other luxury goods. To keep track of these corrupt payments, the conspirators inside HP Russia kept two sets of books: secret spreadsheets that detailed the categories of recipients of the corrupt funds and sanitized versions that hid the corrupt payments from others outside of HP Russia. They also entered into offthebooks side agreements. As one example, an HP Russia executive executed a letter agreement to pay €2.8 million in purported ?commission? fees to a U.K.registered shell company, which was linked to a director of the Russian government agency responsible for managing the GPO project. HP Russia never disclosed the existence of the agreement to internal or external auditors or management outside of HP Russia and conducted no due diligence of the shell company.""

(""Griffiths Energy"" or ""the Company"") announced today that it reached a settlement and resolution with respect to a previously disclosed charge under section 3(1)(b) of Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (""CFPOA""). As previously disclosed, the matter involved certain contracts entered into by the prior management and Board of Directors of Griffiths Energy during the period between August 30, 2009 and February 9, 2011. Prior management entered into consulting contracts (the ""Contracts"") with two entities owned and controlled by a foreign public official and his spouse. At a court hearing on Tuesday the Company entered a guilty plea to the charge before the Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary, Alberta and agreed to pay a total fine of C$10.35 million. Today the Court accepted the settlement. ""Griffiths Energy regrets the actions of the prior management and Board. When we discovered the contracts we blew the whistle and cooperated with the authorities because this is how Griffiths Energy's current management and board conduct business,"" said Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The negotiated resolution addresses the interests of all stakeholders. Now that the matter is closed, Griffiths Energy can focus all of its attention on oil exploration, development and production in Chad."" In November 2011, as previously announced, Griffiths Energy voluntarily disclosed to the appropriate authorities that it had commenced an internal investigation into the Contracts. The exhaustive investigation, supervised by a special committee of independent directors of the Board and conducted by external legal counsel, was concluded in May 2012. At that time Griffiths Energy voluntarily shared the results with appropriate authorities and worked with them to conclude the matter today. The Company affirms that no influence was actually obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the foreign public official, and that the award of its Production Sharing Contracts was not in any way connected to the improper promises and benefits indirectly provided to the foreign public official. These proceedings have no impact on the security and veracity of the Company's significant license area in Chad and the case is now closed. Griffiths Energy's conduct since the discovery of these contracts, and the proactive and responsible steps taken by the current management and Board to immediately self-disclose these issues to law enforcement, were described at length by counsel and were considered by the Court to be significant factors in agreeing to the resolution that was jointly recommended by counsel to the Company and the Crown. The Court also took favourable notice that Griffiths Energy was prepared to self-disclose even though Canada had not yet established policies or protocols governing such voluntary disclosures, and Griffiths Energy received no tangible concessions from the authorities when it self-reported.""

The SEC charged the SAP executive, Vicente E. Garcia, in a separate enforcement action last year that included a parallel criminal action. Garcia has been sentenced to 22 months in prison. According to the SEC?s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding: SAP is headquartered in Germany and executes most of its sales through a network of worldwide corporate partners, including a partner in Panama. The bribery scheme involved providing large discounts of up to 82 percent to SAP?s Panamanian partner, who used the excessive discounts to create a slush fund out of which to pay bribes to Panamanian officials on Garcia?s behalf so SAP could sell software. SAP had no requirements for heightened anti-corruption scrutiny for such large discounts. SAP falsely recorded the slush fund as legitimate discounts on the books of SAP?s Mexican subsidiary, and the figures were subsequently consolidated into SAP?s financial statements. SAP failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting controls to provide reasonable assurances that the discounts were recorded in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.""

In the event, although the potential for corrupt practices to affect this type of business were well known, Standard Bank, which did not have adequate measures in place to guard against such risks, relied on Stanbic to conduct appropriate due diligence in relation to EGMA; Standard Bank made no enquiry about EGMA or its role. 8. The mandate to raise the funds was placed with Standard Bank and Stanbic and US $600 million was raised but there is no evidence that EGMA provided any services in relation to the transaction. Meanwhile, EGMA had opened a bank account with Stanbic and its fee of US $6 million was paid (as agreed) via Stanbic into the account.

According to the SEC?s complaint, the misconduct went beyond the use of agents or other third parties. Weatherford provided improper travel and entertainment to officials of a state-owned company in Algeria with no legitimate business purpose. For example, Weatherford paid for a 2006 FIFA World Cup trip by two of the officials, the July 2006 honeymoon of an official?s daughter, and an October 2005 religious trip to Saudi Arabia by an official and his family that was improperly recorded as a donation in Weatherford?s books and records. Weatherford?s Middle East subsidiary also made more than $1.4 million in improper payments to obtain nine contracts under the Oil-for-Food program in 2002. Iraqi ministries demanded improper ?inland transportation fees? in an effort to subvert the UN program. Weatherford?s subsidiary complied with the Iraqi demands and paid more than $115,000 in fees despite invoices that included charges inconsistent with the actual deliveries. Weatherford obtained more than $7 million in profits from the misconduct. The SEC further alleges that managers at Weatherford?s subsidiary in Italy flouted the lack of internal controls and misappropriated more than $200,000 in company funds, some of which was improperly paid to Albanian tax auditors. The managers misreported cash advances, diverted payments on previously paid invoices, misappropriated government rebate checks, and received reimbursement for such purchases as golf equipment and perfume that did not relate to business activities. According to the SEC?s complaint, Weatherford employees created false accounting and inventory records from 2002 to 2007 to hide the illegal commercial sales to Cuba, Syria, Sudan, and Iran. During this time period, exporting or re-exporting goods or services from the U.S. to these sanctioned countries was prohibited. The falsified financial statements and books and records of Weatherford subsidiaries involved in the misconduct were consolidated into the financial statements of the parent company.""

https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/printpdf/20483,Weatherford International Limited,Iraq (UN Oil-for-Food); Unspecified Africa and Middle East countries,Criminal,Criminal Fine,Internal controls violations,"According to the US Department of Justice, ""Weatherford Services Limited (Weatherford Services), a subsidiary of Weatherford International, today agreed to plead guilty to violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. As part of a coordinated FCPA resolution, the department today also filed a criminal information in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas charging Weatherford International with one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA. To resolve the charge, Weatherford International has agreed to pay an $87.2 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the today agreed to pay a combined $100 million to resolve a criminal and administrative export controls investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney?s Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Department of Commerce?s Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Department of the Treasury?s Office of Foreign Assets Control. As part of the resolution of that investigation, Weatherford International has agreed to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement for a term of two years and two of its subsidiaries have agreed to plead guilty to Weatherford subsidiaries, the entry by Weatherford International into two deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement, and the payment of a total of $252,690,606 in penalties and fines. FCPA Violations According to court documents filed by the department, prior to 2008, Weatherford International knowingly failed to establish an effective system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent corruption, including FCPA violations. The company failed to implement these internal controls despite operating in an industry with a substantial corruption risk profile and despite growing its global footprint in large part by purchasing existing companies, often themselves in countries with high corruption risks. As a result, a permissive and uncontrolled environment existed within which employees of certain of Weatherford International?s wholly owned subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East were able to engage in corrupt conduct over the course of many years, including both bribery of foreign officials and fraudulent misuse of the United Nations? Oil for Food Program. Court documents state that Weatherford Services employees established and operated a joint venture in Africa with two local entities controlled by foreign officials and their relatives from 2004 through at least 2008. The foreign officials selected the entities with which Weatherford Services would partner, and Weatherford Services and Weatherford International employees knew that the members of the local entities included foreign officials? relatives and associates. Notwithstanding the fact that the local entities did not contribute capital, expertise or labor to the joint venture, neither Weatherford Services nor Weatherford International investigated why the local entities were involved in the joint venture. The sole purpose of those local entities, in fact, was to serve as conduits through which Weatherford Services funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the foreign officials controlling them. In exchange for the payments they received from Weatherford Services through the joint venture, the foreign officials awarded the joint venture lucrative contracts, gave Weatherford Services inside information about competitors? pricing, and took contracts away from Weatherford Services? competitors and awarded them to the joint venture. Additionally, Weatherford Services employees in Africa bribed a foreign official so that he would approve the renewal of an oil services contract, according to court documents. Weatherford Services funneled bribery payments to the foreign official through a freight forwarding agent it retained via a consultancy agreement in July 2006. Weatherford Services generated sham purchase orders for consulting services the freight forwarding agent never performed, and the freight forwarding agent, in turn, generated sham invoices for those same nonexistent services. When paid for those invoices, the freight forwarding agent passed at least some of those monies on to the foreign official with the authority to approve Weatherford Services? contract renewal. In exchange for these payments, the foreign official awarded the renewal contract to Weatherford Services in 2006. Further, according to court documents, in a third scheme in the Middle East, from 2005 through 2011, employees of Weatherford Oil Tools Middle East Limited (WOTME), another Weatherford International subsidiary, awarded improper ?volume discounts? to a distributor who supplied Weatherford International products to a government-owned national oil company, believing that those discounts were being used to create a slush fund with which to make bribe payments to decision-makers at the national oil company. Between 2005 and 2011, WOTME paid approximately $15 million in volume discounts to the distributor.""(Source: US DOJ Press Release, ""Three Subsidiaries of Weatherford International Limited Agree to Plead Guilty to FCPA and Export Control Violations,"" November 26, 2013.)"

The SEC alleges that subsidiaries of the Swiss-based global manufacturer perpetuated schemes that typically involved payments of fake ?commissions? or the use of third-party agents to funnel money improperly to obtain lucrative contracts. Overall, Tyco reaped illicit benefits amounting to more than $10.5 million as a result of the paid to win business. Tyco, whose securities are publicly traded in the U.S., agreed to pay more than $26 million to settle the SEC?s charges and resolve a criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of schemes around the world starting before 2006 and continuing until 2009. The most profitable scheme occurred in Germany, where agents of a Tyco subsidiary paid third parties to secure contracts or avoid penalties or fines in several countries. These payments were falsely recorded as ?commissions? in Tyco?s books and records when they were in fact bribes to pay off government customers. Tyco?s benefit as a result of these illicit payments was more than $4.6 million. According to the SEC?s complaint, Tyco?s subsidiary in China signed a contract with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security for $770,000 but reportedly paid approximately $3,700 to the ?site project team? of a state-owned corporation to be able to obtain the contract. This amount was improperly recorded as a commission. Tyco?s subsidiary in France recorded payments to individuals from 2005 to 2009 for ?business introduction services.?

The investigation was closed after SIT admitted inadequate enforcement of compliance regulations in relation to Yamal gas pipeline projects and paid CHF 125,000 in reparation. SIT also paid US$ 10.6 million in compensation for unlawfully obtained profits. The OAG investigated the circumstances behind contracts awarded to the Swedish company, acquired by Siemens in 2003, for the supply of gas turbines during the construction of the pipeline, which runs from the gas fields on the Russian Yamal peninsula to Western Europe. In the course of project, initiated by Russia's largest natural gas production company, bribes were paid to senior executives of the Russian state-owned company. SIT made the unlawful payments between 2004 and 2006 via bank accounts held by the end recipients in Switzerland. This was the connecting factor that gave rise to the OAG's investigation. The SIT accepts that it did not take all the required and reasonable organisational steps to prevent bribes being paid to foreign public officials in connection with projects to build compressor stations and to supply gas turbines for the Yamal pipeline network. In particular, it admitted basic failures in checking consultancy agreements. The company is therefore guilty of organisational offences under Art. 102 of the Swiss Criminal Code (SCC). SIT has paid reparation of CHF 125,000 in the form of a donation to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). As a consequence, the OAG closed the investigation into SIT based on Art. 53 SCC and at the same time ordered the forfeiture of unlawfully obtained assets. The profits obtained unlawfully from the projects concerned amount to US$ 10.6 million. The OAG ordered SIT to pay a corresponding sum in compensation to the State (Art. 71 para. 1 SCC).

PBSJ is now known as The Atkins North America Holdings Corporation and no longer offers public stock in the U.S. According to the SEC, its ""investigation found that Walid Hatoum, who has agreed to settle the SEC?s charges, offered to funnel funds to a local company owned and controlled by a foreign official in order to secure two multi-million Qatari government contracts for PBSJ in 2009.

The project was divided into two phases: a planning and feasibility period called ?Phase I? and an installation period called ?Phase II.? The MOI was responsible for overseeing the KSP, including selecting contractors to facilitate its implementation. Revenues from the Phase II contract were expected to be substantially greater than from Phase I. According to admissions made in connection with both the nonprosecution agreement and Rama?s plea agreement, IAP and Rama schemed to ensure that IAP worked as the consultant for Phase I so that it could tailor the requirements for the Phase II contracts to IAP?s strengths, which would give the company an advantage in the Phase II bidding. To that end, both IAP and Rama admitted that in February 2006, executives and senior employees of IAP, including Rama, set up a shell company called ?Ramaco? to bid on Phase I, in part to conceal IAP?s role in crafting the Phase II requirements and its conflict of interest in connection with securing the Phase II contract. Ultimately, Ramaco secured the Phase I contract for approximately $4 million. According to admissions made in connection with both agreements, the Rama and IAP agreed that half of that amount would be diverted to a consultant who would pay bribes to Kuwaiti government officials to assist IAP in obtaining and retaining the Phase I contract and to obtain the Phase II contract. IAP and Rama admitted that they disguised the payments by transferring funds Ramaco received to an IAP bank account and then to the consultant through a series of accounts and intermediaries.

DAP Global generated more than $66 million in revenue for DAP from transaction fees - in the form of markups and markdowns - on riskless principal trade executions in Venezuelan sovereign or state-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Económico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES). A portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to BANDES Vice President of Finance, María de los Ángeles González de Hernandez, who the roles in the kickback scheme: Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, who lives in Miami and is an executive vice president at DAP. Known as ""Tomas Clarke,"" he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades. Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt, who lives in Panama and received more than $20 million in fraudulent proceeds from DAP via his Panamanian shell company, which then paid Gonzalez a portion of this amount. Jose Alejandro Hurtado, who lives in Miami and served as the intermediary between DAP and Gonzalez. Hurtado was paid more than $6 million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from DAP, and he remitted some of that money to Gonzalez. Haydee Leticia Pabon, who is Hurtado's wife and received approximately $8 million in markups or markdowns on BANDES trades that were funneled to scheme began in October 2008 and continued until at least June 2010. BANDES was a new customer to DAP brought in by DAP Global executives through their connections to Hurtado. As a result of the kickbacks to Gonzalez, DAP obtained BANDES' lucrative trading business and provided Gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with DAP at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by BANDES. Gonzalez used her senior role at the Caracas-based bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to DAP. As the scheme evolved over time, the traders deceived DAP's clearing brokers, executed internal wash trades, inter-positioned another broker-dealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions, and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue. For example, the SEC alleges that in January 2010, the traders and Gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with BANDES as both buyer and seller. These trades - which lacked any legitimate business purpose - caused BANDES to pay DAP more than $10 million in fees, a portion of which was diverted to Gonzalez for authorizing the blatantly fraudulent trades. The SEC further alleges that, giving rise to the adage of no honor among thieves, Clarke and Hurtado frequently falsified the size of DAP's fees in their reports to Gonzalez, which enabled the traders to retain a greater share of the fraudulent profits.""

According to the press release, it was alleged in the court documents that Chinea and DeMeneses, together with three Miami based employees participated in a bribery scheme that ran from late 2008 through 2012, in which Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, a BANDES Vice President of Finance directed trading business to Direct Access Partners, and in return, agents and employees of DAP split the revenue that DAP generated from this trading business with Gonzalez. During this time period, DAP generated over $60 million in commissions from trades with BANDES. As further alleged in court documents, in order to conceal the scheme, payments to Gonzalez, frequently in six figure amounts, were routed through third parties posing as ?foreign finders? and into offshore bank accounts. In several instances, Chinea personally signed checks worth millions of dollars that were made payable to one of these purported ?foreign finders? and later deposited in a Swiss bank account. Chinea and DeMeneses admitted that they agreed to use DAP funds to reimburse DeMeneses and Clarke for the approximately $1.5 million from their personal funds they used to bribe Gonzalez.

Gonzalez was an official at BANDES and oversaw the development bank?s overseas trading activity. At her direction, BANDES conducted substantial trading through the Broker-Dealer. Most of the trades executed by the Broker-Dealer on behalf of BANDES involved fixed-income investments for which the Broker-Dealer charged the bank a mark-up on purchases and a mark-down on sales. The Broker-Dealer also conducted business with Banfoandes, another state development bank in Venezuela that, along with its 2009 successor Banco Bicentenario, operated under the direction of the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance.

Specifically, Gonzalez allegedly received kickbacks and payments from Broker-Dealer agents and employees that were frequently in six-figure amounts. To further conceal the scheme, the kickbacks to Gonzalez were often paid using intermediary corporations and offshore accounts that she held in Switzerland, among other places. For instance, Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado used accounts they controlled in Switzerland to transfer funds to an account Gonzalez allegedly controlled in Switzerland. Additionally, Hurtado and his spouse received substantial compensation from the Broker-Dealer, portions of which Hurtado transferred to an account allegedly held by Gonzalez in Miami and to an account held by an associate of Gonzalez in Switzerland.

An SEC investigation found that Bruker Corporation lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect approximately $230,000 in improper payments out of its China-based offices that falsely recorded them in books and records as legitimate business and marketing expenses. The payments enabled Bruker to realize approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales in China paid more than $111,000 to Chinese government officials under 12 suspicious collaboration agreements contingent on state-owned entities providing research on Bruker products or using Bruker products in demonstration laboratories. The collaboration agreements did not specify the work product that the state-owned entities had to provide in order to be paid, and no work product was actually provided to the Bruker office by the state-owned entities. Certain collaboration agreements were executed directly with a Chinese government official rather than the state-owned entity itself, and in some cases Bruker?s office paid the official directly. According to the SEC?s order, the other improper payments involved reimbursements to Chinese government officials for leisure travel to the United States, Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. These officials often were responsible for authorizing the purchase of Bruker products, and the leisure trips typically followed business-related travel for the officials funded by the company. For example, Bruker paid for the purported training expenses of a Chinese government official who signed the sales contract on behalf of a state-owned entity, but the payment actually was reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping, and other leisure activities in Frankfurt and Paris.

An SEC investigation found that ADM?s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and According to the SEC?s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM?s Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million. The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM?s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine.""

https://star.worldbank.org/corruption-cases/printpdf/20358,Alstom S.A. / Marubeni Corporation (Indonesia case),Indonesia,Criminal,Criminal Fine,Conspiracy to Bribe Foreign Officials; Bribery of Foreign Officials,"According to the US Department of Justice, Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading company involved in the handling of products and provision of services in a broad range of sectors around the world, including power generation pleaded guilty in 2014 to ""one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and seven counts of violating the FCPA. The company signed a plea agreement in which it admitted its criminal conduct, agreed to maintain and implement an enhanced global anti-corruption compliance program and to cooperate with the department?s ongoing investigation, and agreed to pay an $88 million fine, which the court accepted in imposing the sentence. The plea agreement cites Marubeni?s refusal to cooperate with the department?s investigation when given the opportunity to do so, its lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the offense, and its failure to timely remediate as several of the factors considered by the department in determining the resolution. According to the court filings, Marubeni and its employees, together with others, paid bribes to officials in Indonesia ? including a high-ranking member of the Indonesian Parliament and high-ranking members of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity company in Indonesia ? in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for the company and its consortium partner to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, Marubeni and its consortium partner retained two consultants purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of the power company and its subsidiaries in connection with the Tarahan project. The primary purpose for hiring the consultants, however, was to use the consultants to pay bribes to Indonesian officials. Also according to court filings, the first consultant retained by Marubeni and its co-conspirators received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his U.S. bank account to be used to bribe the member of Parliament. The consultant then allegedly transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of the official. E-mails between the co-conspirators discuss in detail the use of the first consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project. As admitted in court documents, in the fall of 2003, Marubeni and its co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was not effectively bribing key officials at PLN. As a result, Marubeni and its consortium partner decided to reduce the first consultant?s commission from three percent of the total contract value to one percent, and pay the remaining two percent to a second consultant who could more effectively bribe officials at PLN. In an e-mail between two employees of Marubeni?s consortium partner, they discussed a meeting between Marubeni, an executive from the consortium partner, and the first consultant, stating that the consultant Marubeni and its co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials. Frederic Pierucci, a current executive at Marubeni?s consortium partner, pleaded guilty on July 29, 2013, to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. David Rothschild, a former vice president of regional sales at the consortium partner, pleaded guilty on Nov. 2, 2012 to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Lawrence Hoskins, a former senior vice president for the Asia region for the consortium partner, and William Pomponi, a former vice president of regional sales at the consortium partner, were charged in a second superseding indictment on July 30, 2013.""

Allianz learned of the improper payments from two complaints made several years apart.

The Greek government paid DePuy International Limited's intermediaries of this case, criminal sanction of the Greek conduct has been achieved by the conclusion of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with DePuy International Limited's parent company and the DOJ. The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has concluded that a prosecution was therefore prevented in this jurisdiction by the principles of double jeopardy. The underlying purpose of the rule against double jeopardy is to stop a defendant from being prosecuted twice for the same offence in different jurisdictions. The DOJ Deferred Prosecution Agreement has the legal character of a formally concluded prosecution and punishes the same conduct in Greece that had formed the basis of the Serious Fraud Office investigation. Combined criminal and civil sanctions have therefore been imposed in the United States in respect of Depuy International Limited's parent and assets have been frozen in the ongoing Greek investigation, all relating to the same conduct in Greece. Consequently the Serious Fraud office is satisfied that the most appropriate sanction is a Civil Recovery Order, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. As has been described approximately £33.5 million represents the sales, tainted by the unlawful conduct, made to public hospitals by DePuy International Limited's Greek intermediaries. Approximately £14.8 million of this passed from the Greek intermediary to DePuy International Limited in respect of orthopaedic products for use in the public health care system. Consequently £14.8 million can be said to represent unlawfully obtained property. In the context of a global resolution, the Serious Fraud Office has taken particular note of the fact of disgorgement and recovery in more than one jurisdiction for the same underlying unlawful conduct. The Serious Fraud Office has also taken into account asset tracing difficulties.""

(""Siemens Argentina""), paid bribes to senior Argentine government officials -- including two Presidents, and Cabinet Ministers in two Presidential administrations. The bribes were initially paid to secure a $1 billion government contract (the ""DNI Contract"") to produce national identity cards, or Documentos Nacionales de Identidad, for every Argentine citizen. Later, after a change in Argentine political administrations resulted in the DNI Contract being suspended and then canceled, Siemens paid additional bribes in a failed effort to bring the DNI Contract back into force. Still later, after the company instituted an arbitration proceeding to recover its costs and expected profits from the canceled DNI Contract, Siemens paid additional bribes to suppress evidence that the DNI Contract had originally been obtained through corruption. Over the course of the bribery scheme, over $100 million in bribes were paid, approximately $31.3 million of which were made after March 12, 2001, when Siemens became a U.S. issuer subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of the bribe payments it made, Siemens received an arbitration award in 2007 against the government of Argentina of over $217 million plus interest for the DNI Contract. In August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the U.S. and Germany, Siemens waived the arbitration award. During the relevant 2001 to 2007 time period, defendants Uriel Sharef, Ulrich Bock, Carlos Sergi, Stephan Signer, Herbert Steffen, Andres Truppel, and Bernd Regendantz each had a role in authorizing, negotiating, facilitating, or concealing bribe payments in connection with the DNI Contract. Siemens employed a group of consultants, designated the Project Group and led by defendant Sergi, to serve as payment intermediaries between the company and the Argentine government officials.""

He was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay GBP 100,000 in compensation within 28 days to the Republic of Costa Rica or serve an additional 12 months imprisonment if he fails to do so. The corrupt payments were: (1) in 1999, a payment of $25,832.22 to Roxana Cordero Bogantes, the wife of Alvaro Alcuna, an agent of the Instituto Nacional de Seguros of the Republic of Costa Rica, and (2) in 2002, payment of $250,000 to Reska Financial Inc., a company associated with an agent of the Instituto Nacional de Seguros of the Republic of Costa Rica, namely Critobal Zawadski; both payments were as inducment or reward for assisting in the appointment or retention of PWS International Limited as broker of the reinsurance contract known as ""U-500."" The Press Release also noted that between 1999 and 2002, Messent authorized 41 corrupt payments totalling $1,982,230.77 to Costa Rican officials, their wives and associated companies. This was a joint investigation by the SFO and the City of London Police. Following elections in Costa Rica in 2002, officials in INS and ICE were replaced. Enquiries were made into the contract with PWS and the payments made unider it; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office referred the case to SFO in October 2005.

Turner, a former Business Director at Innospec, Inc., and Ousama M. Naaman, Innospec's agent in Iraq, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to numerous government officials to obtain and retain business.The SEC's complaint alleges that: Turner and Naaman engaged in widespread bribery of Iraqi government officials to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program, and in order to continue selling Tetra Ethyl Lean (TEL) to Iraq after the Oil for Food Program ended. Turner also violated the FCPA by paying bribes to Indonesian officials to sell TEL to Indonesian state owned oil companies. From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and specialty chemicals, routinely paid bribes to government officials in Iraq and Indonesia to sell TEL. The bribery activities in Iraq began with Innospec's participation in the United Nations (""UN"") Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until at least 2008. Turner, the Business Director of Innospec's TEL group, and Naaman, Innospec's agent, both actively participated in the bribery and kickback schemes in Iraq. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesia's need for TEL ended. Turner actively participated in the bribery scheme in Indonesia. In all, Innospec made illicit payments of over $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials. The contracts that Innospec obtained in exchange for the bribes were worth approximately $176 million. Naaman paid kickbacks to Iraq on Innospec's behalf so that Innospec could obtain five Oil-for-Food Program contracts for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries. Naaman aided Innospec in obtaining the Oil for Food contracts by paying kickbacks equaling 10 percent of the contract value on three of the contracts. When the Oil-for-Food Program ended shortly before Innospec was to pay promised kickbacks on the two remaining contracts, Innospec kept the promised payments as paid bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure TEL business contracts from Iraq. Turner and senior officials at Innospec directed and approved the bribery payments. From at least 2004 through 2008, Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional $884,480. In one e-mail, Naaman informed management, including Turner, that that the requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2% ""commission"" to Naaman. Turner and senior officials at Innospec also directed Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000 to Iraqi officials to ensure the failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of Innospec. Turner and other Innospec officials also arranged for Naaman to pay thousands of dollars in cash to Iraqi officials for ""pocket money"" on trips funded by Innospec."" The Litigation Release also noted that ""Naaman will disgorge $810,076 plus prejudgment interest of $67,030, and pay a civil penalty of $438,038, which will be deemed satisfied by a criminal order requiring Naaman to pay a criminal fine that is at least equal to the civil penalty amount.

Under HealthSouth's contract with a Saudi foundation which built and owned the hospital, HealthSouth was to receive $10 million annually over a five-year term. According to the criminal informations, the Saudi foundation's director general solicited a $1 million payment from HealthSouth, ostensibly as a ""finders fee."" Against the advice of counsel, HealthSouth allegedly agreed to pay the Saudi foundation's director general the sum of $500,000 per year for a five-year period in return for his agreement to execute the contract on behalf of the Saudi foundation. In order to conceal the true nature of the scheme, HealthSouth officers, including Nico and Carman, allegedly arranged for the foundation's director general to execute a bogus consulting contract with a HealthSouth-affiliated entity in Australia. Until the scheme was detected in 2003, HealthSouth paid the amounts due under this phony consulting contract by wiring them to Australia, where they were subsequently wired to the foundation's director general in Saudi Arabia, according to the charges. The HealthSouth officers allegedly undertook this conduct despite the fact that they had been specifically advised beforehand by an attorney retained by HealthSouth that such conduct would amount to a violation of federal criminal law. The criminal information against Nico charges that he violated his duty of honest services to HealthSouth by accepting a kickback from the foundation's director general whereby Nico received $125,000 per year from the $500,000 paid to the foundation's director general. Under this agreement, Nico received a total of $375,000 in undisclosed payments.

According to the SEC's administrative filing, since at least 2003 and through approximately the end of 2004, Bristow Group's Nigerian affiliate, Pan African Airlines Nigeria Ltd. (PAAN), made improper payments totaling $423,000 to employees of the governments of two Nigerian states to influence them to improperly reduce the amount of expatriate employment taxes payable by PAAN to the respective Nigerian state governments. At the end of each year, PAAN was subject to an expatriate ""Pay As You Earn"" (PAYE) tax, which was assessed on the salaries of PAAN employees by the government of each Nigerian state where PAAN operated. PAAN then negotiated with government tax officials to lower the amount assessed. In each instance, the PAYE tax demand amount was lowered and a separate cash payment for the tax officials was negotiated. Once PAAN paid the state government and the tax officials, each state government provided PAAN with a receipt reflecting only the amount payable to the state government. All together, PAAN secured an $854,000 reduction in its PAYE tax liability in exchange for these improper payments. During that same time period, Bristow Group underreported PAAN and another Bristow Group Nigerian affiliate's payroll expenses to certain Nigerian state governments. As a result, Bristow Group's periodic reports filed with the SEC did not accurately reflect certain of the company's payroll-related expenses. Accordingly, the SEC's administrative order found that during this time period, Bristow Group had both lacked sufficient internal accounting controls and mischaracterized the payments as legitimate payroll expenses on its books and records.""

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, alleges that from 2002 through 2007 Panalpina, Inc. (Panalpina), in concert with other PWT subsidiaries and affiliates (Panalpina Group), bribed government officials in countries including Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Russia, and Kazakhstan. The bribes were paid by Panalpina to obtain preferential customs, duties, and import treatment for its customers in connection with international freight shipments. Although PWT, Panalpina, and the Panalpina Group are not issuers for purposes of the FCPA, many of their customers are. By paying bribes on behalf of issuers, Panalpina both violated and aided and abetted complaint alleges that although the bribery schemes varied, most shared several similarities. The customers often used Panalpina or other Panalpina Group companies to ship goods internationally or sought Panalpina's assistance in obtaining customs or logistics services in the country to which goods were shipped. For various reasons --including delayed departures, insufficient or incorrect documentation, the nature of the goods being shipped and imported, or the refusal of local government officials to provide services without unofficial payments -- Panalpina's customers sometimes faced delays in importing goods. In other cases, Panalpina's customers sought to avoid local customs duties or inspection requirements or otherwise sought to import goods in circumvention of local law. In order to secure the importation of goods under these circumstances, Panalpina's customers often authorized Panalpina and other Panalpina Group companies to bribe foreign officials. The complaint further alleges that Panalpina Group companies invoiced Panalpina's customers for the bribes. The invoices, which contained both legitimate and illegitimate charges, concealed the bribes by inaccurately referring to them as ""local processing,"" ""special intervention,"" ""special handing,"" and other seemingly legitimate fees. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Panalpina consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement and permanently enjoining it from violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions. These provisions are codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval."

Although Noble was required to move its rigs out of Nigeria when TIPs and any extensions had expired, it did not do so in order to avoid the costs of moving the rigs, the potential loss of profits, and the break in performance of rigs under contract. Noble used the customs agents to submit false documents to Nigerian Customs Service showing export and re-import of its drilling rigs when in fact the rigs never moved.

The two-count information charges Marubeni with one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA. Marubeni is a Japanese trading company headquartered in Tokyo. According to court documents, Marubeni was hired as an agent by the four-company TSKJ joint venture to help TSKJ obtain and retain EPC contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria, by offering to pay and paying bribes to Nigerian government officials, among other means. TSKJ was comprised of Technip S.A., Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V., Kellogg Brown & Root Inc. (KBR) and JGC Corporation. Between 1995 and 2004, TSKJ was awarded four EPC contracts, valued at more than $6 billion, by Nigeria LNG Ltd. to build the LNG facilities on Bonny Island. The government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was the largest shareholder of NLNG, owning 49 percent of the company. According to court documents, to assist in obtaining and retaining the EPC contracts, the joint venture hired two agents -- Marubeni and Jeffrey Tesler, a U.K. solicitor -- to pay bribes to a wide range of Nigerian government officials. The joint venture hired Tesler as a consultant to pay bribes to high-level Nigerian government officials, including top-level executive branch officials, and hired Marubeni to pay bribes to lower-level Nigerian government officials. At crucial junctures preceding the award of EPC contracts, a number of co-conspirators, including on two occasions an employee of Marubeni, met with successive holders of a top-level office in the executive branch of the Nigerian government to ask the office holders to designate a representative with whom TSKJ should negotiate bribes to Nigerian government officials.
