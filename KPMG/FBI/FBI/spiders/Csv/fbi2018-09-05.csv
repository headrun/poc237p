McCool solicited and induced members of the public to invest approximately $10 million in Brixon by making fraudulent and misleading representations concerning how the money would be used, the rates of return, the security of the investments, and their own qualifications to conduct such investments. Reportedly, McCool promised investors that their money would be invested in European investment programs and used as reserves for high-yield insurance company portfolio investments. Investors were told that Brixon would generate returns of 10 percent per month. Investors were also falsely promised that they could not lose their principal investment because the principal was insured by the State Bar of California.

Authorities are asking any motorists who may have seen a car fitting the description, driving erratically, or filled with red smoke on Route 19 or Interstates 70 or 79 to notify law enforcement officials. In addition to creating red smoke, the dye pack, upon explosion, would have caused burns and other irritation to the suspect or anyone in the car with him and stains on the hands of anyone who handled the money.
